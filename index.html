  <h1>The Xian Incident</h1>
  <p>By Brian Flaherty</p>
<embed src="xian.swf" width="600" height="400">
<p>We are woken in long-dead night.
Crickets stilled, the silent planets 
altered in their course. The wind
wishing its spirit through shuttered windows.

Urgent, angry voices carry across 
the compound, a wall map 
flaring into coloured campaign
before the dancing torches.

Rising you dislodge a vase
blue shards petalled across the stone
and slippered, flee the chamber
past Nine Dragon Pool, the white
leaf currents of winter.

Your dark hair untied, sweeping my face,
famous breast thrown free from your gown.

Breath is a silk moth climbing
your chest, catching dusty wings
under this rib â€“ an insect fury 

And reaching Black Horse Mountain
we  climb, scramble hand over hand
through  sharp pomegranates and finally
high into the waving pines.

Crouching there fearful, a moment
under Black Tortoise sky
Thighs, knees touching, we listen 
for pursuit, breath escaping our mouths 
as white flags opening to heaven 
our two trembling hearts.

<p>We are woken in long-dead night.<br>
Crickets stilled, the silent planets <br>
altered in their course. The wind<br>
wishing its spirit through shuttered windows.<br>

Urgent, angry voices carry across <br>
the compound, a wall map <br>
flaring into coloured campaign<br>
before the dancing torches.<br>

Rising you dislodge a vase<br>
blue shards petalled across the stone<br>
and slippered, flee the chamber<br>
past Nine Dragon Pool, the white<br>
leaf currents of winter.<br>

Your dark hair untied, sweeping my face,<br>
famous breast thrown free from your gown.<br>

Breath is a silk moth climbing<br>
your chest, catching dusty wings<br>
under this rib â€“ an insect fury <br>

And reaching Black Horse Mountain<br>
we  climb, scramble hand over hand<br>
through  sharp pomegranates and finally<br>
high into the waving pines.<br>

Crouching there fearful, a moment<br>
under Black Tortoise sky<br>
Thighs, knees touching, we listen <br>
for pursuit, breath escaping our mouths <br>
as white flags opening to heaven <br>
our two trembling hearts.<br>

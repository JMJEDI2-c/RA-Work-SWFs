I'm always sir , generally in the high 40s, everyone tells me. On the bright side (I've attached a few photos) a nice view of the Gulf - the beach just across the road, six-lane road but easy to cross. We went down to get our fingerprints taken. You don't want to be too heavy-handed with the ethanol, sand and dust blow with it. I'm almost always suprised. It's Kuwait. Its every bit as bad.
